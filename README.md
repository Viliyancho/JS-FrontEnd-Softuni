# JS-FrontEnd - Softuni
 
This repository contains JavaScript files that I developed approximately one year ago as part of my personal projects. The code represents my learning journey and experimentation with various JavaScript concepts at the time.

I am sharing these files now to showcase my previous work and to contribute to my portfolio. I want to clarify that all the code included in this repository is original and was created by me. There has been only one commit so far, as I wanted to keep it simple and focused on the initial release of these files.

Please feel free to review the code, provide feedback, or ask questions regarding any part of it. I appreciate your understanding and look forward to engaging with the community!
